--- # Task Name and information
task: LIGN101 IPA Training
author: Will Styler
otherdefault: "Hmm, that's not the right symbol, try another!"
training: For each of the following words, you'll be given both a word in English, and a sound file.
    Making reference to the sound file, you'll give us each sound in the word, one by one.
    So, for each word, enter the first complete sound.  This can be a single IPA character, like 's', or, for something more complicated like affricates (e.g. t͡ʃ) or diphthongs (e.g. ej) or other multi-symbol characters, you might enter multiple symbols at one.  When you think you've entered the symbol(s) assocated with the first sound completely, press 'Submit sound' to check your work. Then, do this for the remaining sounds, and when you feel like you've finished all the sounds in the word, click 'End Word'.

--- # Words
word1:
    displayword: "horse"
    soundfile: "horse.wav"
    1:
        "/h": "No need to use slashes or brackets here!"
        "h": Correct
    2:
        "ɔ": Correct
        "o": "In some dialects, /o/ occurs here, but for this class, use /ɔ/"
        ["oʊ","ow"]: "In some dialects, /o/ occurs here, but certainly not the full diphthong. Try again!"
        "u": "Say 'boo', now 'horse'.  Is your tongue in the same place?"
    3:
        "ɹ": Correct
        "r": "Be careful, /r/ is a voiced alveolar trill (think the Spanish 'rolled' R). What's the English symbol?"
        ["əɹ", "ɚ"]: "This isn't a full on vowel (like in 'curb'), but just a consonant"
    4:
        "s": Correct
        "z": "You're mostly right, but Check if this is really voiced or voiceless"
    5:
        "": Correct
        ["e","ej"]: "Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you."
        other: "Don't let your writing system lie to you!"

word2:
    displayword: "choice"
    soundfile: "choice.wav"
    1:
        ["tʃ","t͡ʃ"]: Correct
        ["dʒ","d͡ʒ"]: "You're on the right track, but is this really voiced?  Double check that"
        "c": "Remember, /c/ is a voiceless palatal stop, and that symbol isn't used in the IPA for English"
        "ch": "The <ch> sound isn't done using a /c/ or an /h/ in IPA.  Think about where your tongue is to start, and remember the 'chocolate' example in lecture!"
        "tsh": "There's a different symbol for the <sh> sound.  Use it!"
        "ts": "/ts/ is also an affricate, but it's the sound at the end of 'cats'"
    2:
        ["oj","oɪ"]: Correct
        "o": "This isn't just an /o/, but something more."
        "oi": "This is absolutely a diphthing, and you're on the right track, but we write this diphthong as /oj/ in this class (because it's not ending quite as high as /i/."
        ["ej", "eɪ"]: "This is the diphthong in 'bay' or 'rain'.  Try another."
        ["aj", "aɪ"]: "This is the diphthong in 'buy' or 'rice'.  Try another."
    3:
        "s": Correct
        "z": "You're almost there, but is this a voiced or voiceless sound?"
        "c": "Remember, /c/ is a voiceless palatal stop, and that symbol isn't used in the IPA for English.  What -sound- is there?"
    4:
        "": Correct
        ["e","ej","ɛ","ə]: "Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you."
        other: "Don't let your writing system lie to you!"
