  For each of the following words, you'll be given both a word in English, and a
  sound file. Making reference to the sound file, you'll give us each sound in the
  word, one by one. So, for each word, enter the first complete sound.  This can
  be a single IPA character, like 's', or, for something more complicated like
  affricates (e.g. t͡ʃ) or diphthongs (e.g. ej) or other multi-symbol characters,
  you might enter multiple symbols at one.  When you think you've entered the
  symbol(s) associated with the first sound completely, press 'Submit sound' to
  check your work. Then, do this for the remaining sounds, and when you feel like
  you've finished all the sounds in the word, click 'End Word'.

  - display: horse
    audio: horse.wav
    segments:
      - h: true
        /...: No need to use slashes or brackets here!
        "[...": No need to use slashes or brackets here!
      - ɔ: true
        o: In some dialects, /o/ occurs here, but for this class, use /ɔ/
        _ow: In some dialects, /o/ occurs here, but certainly not the full diphthong. Try again!
        u: Say 'boo', now 'horse'. Is your tongue in the same place?
      - ɹ: true
        r: Be careful, /r/ is a voiced alveolar trill (think the Spanish 'rolled' R). What's the English symbol?
        _əɹ: This isn't a full on vowel (like in 'curb'), but just a consonant
      - s: true
        z: You're mostly right, but check if this is really voiced or voiceless
        # passing in an explicit `""` symbol (the empty string) is fully optional. It's mostly just
        # to make explicitly clear that this is the end of the word. If not provided
        # it is implied. You don't even need to specify it.
      - "": true
        _e_is_a_lie: Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you.
        # special symbol `...` is equivalent to any other inputs.
        ...: Don't let your writing system lie to you!
  - display: choice
    audio: choice.wav
    segments:
      - _ch: true
        _j: You're on the right track, but is this really voiced? Double check that
        c: Remember, /c/ is a voiceless palatal stop, and that symbol isn't used in the IPA for English
        ch: The <ch> sound isn't done using a /c/ or an /h/ in IPA.  Think about where your tongue is to start, and remember the 'chocolate' example in lecture!
        tsh: There's a different symbol for the <ch> sound. Use it!
        ts: /ts/ is also an affricate, but it's the sound at the end of 'cats'
        t: Remember, the <ch> sound is comprised of two sounds combined
      - _ɔj: true
        ɔ: This isn't just an /ɔ/, but something more.
        ɔi: >
          This isn't absolutely a diphthong, and you're on the right track,
          but we write this diphthong as /ɔj/ in this class (because it's not ending quite as high as /i/.
        _ej: This is the diphthong in 'bay' or 'rain'. Try another.
        _aj: This is the diphthong in 'buy' or 'rice'. Try another.
        o...: Generally speaking, in mainstream US English, /ɔ/ is used here.
      - s: true
        z: You're almost there, but is this a voiced or voiceless sound?
        c: Remember, /c/ is a voiceless palatal stop, and that symbol isn't used in the IPA for English.  What -sound- is there?
      - _e_is_a_lie: Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you.
        ...: Don't let your writing system lie to you!
