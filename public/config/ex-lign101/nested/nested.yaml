  For each of the following words, you'll be given both a word in English, and a
  sound file. Making reference to the sound file, you'll give us each sound in the
  word, one by one, without slashes or brackets. So, for each word, enter the first complete sound.  This can
  be a single IPA character, like 's', or, for something more complicated like
  affricates (e.g. 't͡ʃ') or diphthongs (e.g. 'ej') or other multi-symbol characters,
  you might enter multiple symbols at one.  When you think you've entered the
  symbol(s) associated with the first sound completely, press 'Submit IPA Symbol(s) or Word' to
  check your work. Then, do this for the remaining sounds, and when you feel like
  you've finished all the sounds in the word, click 'Submit' one last time.

        test: Remember, not only is your orthography lying to you, but we also want you to type each sound individually
        tɛst: While that's correct, we want you to transcribe each sound individually (i.e. start with submitting "t")

          For each of the following words, you'll be given both a word in English, and a
          sound file. Making reference to the sound file, you'll give us each sound in the in word.
      - ɛ: true
        e: Your writing system is lying to you here. This vowel only occurs in the diphthong /ej/, and would sound like 'taste'
      - s: true
        st: In this case, /s/ and /t/ are two segments, unlike in affricates or diphthongs. Submit the /s/ first!
      - t: true
        "": Although some dialects of English would simplify this cluster to just /s/, there's a /t/ in this audio file!
  - display: ban
    audio: ../ban.wav
    segments:
      - b: true
        p: No, this is a voiced sound in English (although it sounds like a voiceless sound in many other languages!)
        /...: No need to use slashes or brackets here!
        "[...": No need to use slashes or brackets here!
      - æ: true
        ɑ: No, this vowel would sound like 'bahn' or 'bomb'
        a: This vowel is really only used in diphthongs in English
        ae: It's important to write this vowel as a digraph, /æ/, otherwise it's a VV sequence and very different
        ɔ: Open o?  More like NOPE-n o.  Try another vowel.
      - n: true
        m: This would be a bilabial nasal, made with the lips, like in 'bam'. That's not what's going on here though!
        ŋ: This is a velar nasal like in 'bang', but the sound in this word is made more towards the front of the mouth
      - "": true
