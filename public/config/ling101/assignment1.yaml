instructions: | # <-- The "|" here indicates a multiline string
  For each of the following words, you'll be given both a word in English, and a sound file. Making reference to the
  sound file, you'll give us the IPA character representing each sound in the word, one by one, without slashes or brackets. So, for each word, enter the first complete sound.  This can be a single IPA character, like 's', or, for something more complicated like
  affricates (e.g. 't͡ʃ') or diphthongs (e.g. 'ej') or other multi-symbol characters, you might enter multiple symbols
  at once. No need to mark stress with ' or ̩.  When you think you've entered the symbol(s) associated with the first sound completely, press 'Submit IPA
  Symbol(s) or Word' to check your work. Then, do this for the remaining sounds, and when you feel like you've finished
  all the sounds in the word, click 'Submit' one last time.  At the end of the assignment, you'll get a code to paste into Gradescope.

  Good luck!

          For each of the following words, you'll be given both a word in English, and a
          sound file. Making reference to the sound file, you'll give us each sound in the in word.
      - ɛ: true
        e: Your writing system is lying to you here. This vowel only occurs in the diphthong /ej/ in MUSE, and would sound like 'taste'
      - s: true
        st: In this case, /s/ and /t/ are two segments, unlike in affricates or diphthongs. Submit the /s/ first!
      - t: true
        "": Although some dialects of English would simplify this cluster to just /s/, there's a /t/ in this audio file!
  - display: face
    audio: face.wav
    segments:
      - f: true
      - _ej: true
        æ: Nope, this is the vowel in 'fast'
        ɑ: No, the ɑ vowel would sound like 'fog'
        e: In MUSE, the /e/ vowel is almost always a diphthong, /ej/. So, we'll ask you to write it as such.
        ɛ: This is the vowel in 'fed', not what you want here.
        a: This vowel is really only used in diphthongs in English, and isn't the one you want.
        ɔ: Open o?  More like NOPE-n o.  Try another vowel.
      - s: true
        c: Your writing system is lying to you.  Remember, the IPA /c/ isn't used in English, the written C is always /s/, /k/, or /t͡ʃ/
        z: This would be a voiced sound like 'phase'
      - "": true
        _e_is_a_lie: Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you.
        ...: Don't let your writing system lie to you!
  - display: ban
    audio: ban.wav
    segments:
      - b: true
        p: No, this is a voiced sound in English (although it sounds like a voiceless sound in many other languages!)
      - æ: true
        ɑ: No, the ɑ vowel would sound like 'bahn' or 'bomb'
        a: This vowel is really only used in diphthongs in English, and not here!
        ae: It's important to write this vowel as a digraph, /æ/, otherwise it's a VV sequence and very different
        ɔ: Open o?  More like NOPE-n o.  Try another vowel.
      - n: true
        m: This would be a bilabial nasal, made with the lips, like in 'bam'. That's not what's going on here though!
        ŋ: This is a velar nasal like in 'bang', but the sound in this word is made more towards the front of the mouth

        ɔ: Open o?  More like NOPE-n o.  Try another vowel.
      - n: true
        m: This would be a bilabial nasal, made with the lips, like in 'bam'. That's not what's going on here though!

      - ə: true
        ɘ: You're close, but you want the (similar looking by very different) schwa (/ə/)
        əɹ: This is correct, but you'll want to submit the /ɹ/ separately
        _e_is_a_lie: I think the writing system is lying to you about this vowel
        ɚ: This is a correct answer, but for this class we're using /əɹ/
      - ɹ: true
        r: Remember, /r/ is the Spanish 'rolled' R. For English, you always want /ɹ/
      - "": true
  - display: thing
    audio: thing.wav
    segments:
      - θ: true
        t: There's no /t/ in the English <th>. What symbol do we really want here?
        th: There's no /t/ in the English <th>. What symbol do we really want here?
        ð: "You've got that this is an interdental sound, but is it really voiced? (Hint: No)"
      - ɪ: true
        i: Close, but not quite. /i/ is the vowel in "deed", and is usually longer than the vowel you want here
        e: This vowel is a diphthong for most in mainstream US English, so you'll want to write it as such
        ej: This would be the vowel in 'day'
        ɛ: ɛ is the vowel in 'dent', not ding
        ə: ə is only used in unstressed contexts, and would sound more like 'dung' anyways
        a: This is a low vowel.  Is your jaw really that low when making this sound?
      - ŋ: true
        m: This would be a bilabial nasal, made with the lips, like in 'ram'. That's not what's going on here though!
        n: This is an alveolar nasal like in 'din'.  Is your tongue really at the alveolar ridge for this, or is your writing system lying to you?
      - "": true
        g: There's probably not a separate /g/ sound at the end of this word, unless you're really over-carefully articulating.
  - display: job
    audio: job.wav
    segments:
      - d͡ʒ: true
        dʒ: This is accurate, but you'll want to use the tie bar on top like /d͡ʒ/
        d: This isn't the whole affricate.  Write the whole sound before you submit.
        j: This is the sound at the start of "yacht", I think your writing system may have lied to you here.  What does the <j> here sound like?
      - ɑ: true
        a: /a/ is only used in dipthongs in MUSE.  You want /ɑ/
        ɔ: This is probably a /ɑ/, whether you've got the cot/caught merger or not.
        o: Remember that /ow/ is always a diphthong in my dialect of MUSE
        _ow: This is the vowel in 'boat', and unless you're reading this word as the biblical name 'Job', it isn't the vowel you want here.
      - b: true
      - "": true
        g: There's probably not a separate /g/ sound at the end of this word, unless you're really over-carefully articulating.

    audio: phone.wav
    segments:
      - f: true
        p: Your writing system has told you a whole pile of lies, and this 'p' is one of them.
        ph: Your writing system has told you a whole pile of lies, and this 'ph' is one of them.
      - _ow: true
        o: This should be /ow/, the diphthong
        u: This would the vowel in 'fool'
        ʊ: This would be the vowel in 'foot'
      - n: true
        m: This would be a bilabial nasal, made with the lips, like in 'foam'. That's not what's going on here though!
      - "": true
        e: This <e> is a lie, through and through
        ...: Don't let your writing system lie to you!
  - display: plotter
    audio: plotter.wav
    segments:
      - p: true
        b: This is a voiceless sound in English.
      - l: true
      - ɑ: true
        ɔ: This is probably a /ɑ/, whether you've got the cot/caught merger or not.
        o: Remember that /ow/ is always a diphthong in my dialect of MUSE
        _ow: This is the vowel in 'boat', and unless you're reading this word as the biblical name 'Job', it isn't the vowel you want here.
      - ɾ: true
        t: Phonologically this is a /t/ for sure, but in practice, it's a tap /ɾ/ for most people in connected speech in MUSE
        d: This isn't a /d/, it's a tap /ɾ/, much shorter.
        r: You're right that this sound is a lot like the /r/ in Spanish, but in English, it's /ɾ/
      - ə: true
        əɹ: This is correct, but you'll want to submit the /ɹ/ separately
        _e_is_a_lie: I think the writing system is lying to you about this vowel
        ɚ: This is a correct answer, but for this class we're using /əɹ/

        r: Remember, /r/ is the Spanish 'rolled' R. For English, you always want /ɹ/
      - "": true
  - display: though
    audio: though.wav
    segments:
      - ð: true
        t: There's no /t/ in the English <th>. What symbol do we really want here?
        th: There's no /t/ in the English <th>. What symbol do we really want here?
        θ: "You've got that this is an interdental sound, but is it really voiceless? (Hint: No)"
      - _ow: true

        i: Nope, this is the vowel in 'meat'
        ə: No, this is a stressed vowel, and not schwa-like
        ʌ: No, this doesn't sound like 'mutt'
      - ʔ: true
        t: It's certainly spelled with a /t/, and there's often a bit of /t/ like articulation, and you could say it with a full on /t/, but is it really just a /t/ in the sound file? What's going on in the larynx?
        d: Not a voiced sound in the middle here.  What else could be going on?
        ɾ: Taps are the sounds in 'later' or 'ladder'. Not the same thing here.
        HINT: This is a glottal stop /ʔ/ for most American speakers, and that's the correct answer here
      - n̩: true
        ə: Yes, this is often written /ən/, but for this, let's use a syllabic /n/ (n̩)
        n: This is all /n/, you're right, but since it's its own syllable, mark it syllabic (n̩)
        ɪ: This can feel like a final /ɪn/ in careful speech, but in practice, it's usually a syllabic /n/ (n̩).  Use that.
        e: Your writing system is lying to you
        ʌ: Yes, this is often written /ən/, which sounds a lot like /ʌ/, but for this, let's use a syllabic /n/ (n̩)
      - "": true
  - display: rage
    audio: rage.wav
    segments:
      - ɹ: true
        r: This is the Voiced Alveolar Trill, the Spanish 'Rolled R'. You want the English R, /ɹ/.
        l: Nope, you've got the wrong sonorant here.
      - _ej: true
        e: This vowel is a diphthong for most in mainstream US English, so you'll want to write it as such
        ɛ: ɛ is the vowel in 'rent', not rain
        ə: ə is only used in unstressed contexts, and would sound more like 'run' anyways
        a: This is a low vowel.  Is your jaw really that low when making this sound?
        _aj: I'm thinking your writing system is leading you astray.  This is the vowel in 'rhine' or 'rye'
        ai: Remember, your writing system is a bucket of lies.  Don't let it lead you astray!  /ai/ isn't even a diphthong used in English
      - d͡ʒ: true
        dʒ: This is accurate, but you want the tie bar (d͡ʒ)
        d: This is an affricate, which functions as one unit. You're right that it starts with a /d/, but write the whole thing
        g: Does this really end with a /g/ like "rag" does? Or is this sound something else, and your writing system is lying to you?
      - "": true
        _e_is_a_lie: Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you.
  - display: yoshi
    audio: yoshi.wav
    segments:
      - j: true
        y: Remember, English doesn't use /y/ in IPA, and this is an approximant, not a vowel
        i: You're right that this first bit sounds like an /i/, but it's too fast to be a vowel.  What symbol captures the approximating of the tongue to the palate?
      - _ow: true
        o: This should be /ow/, the diphthong
        u: This would the vowel in 'fool'
        ʊ: This would be the vowel in 'foot'
      - ʃ: true
        s: Nope, not quite an /s/, it's a bit further back in the mouth
        sh: <sh> is how the writing system captures this sound, but the IPA has a different symbol for it
        ʒ: This is a palatoalveolar fricative, yes, but not voiced!
      - i: true
        _ej: Nope, for once, the IPA is like the spelling!
        _e_is_a_lie: Nope, for once, the IPA is like the spelling!
      - "": true
        _e_is_a_lie: Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you.

        o: In some dialects, /o/ occurs here, but for this class, use /ɔ/
        _ow: In some dialects, /o/ occurs here, but certainly not the full diphthong. Try again!
        u: Say 'boo', now 'horse'. Is your tongue in the same place?
      - ɹ: true
        r: Be careful, /r/ is a voiced alveolar trill (think the Spanish 'rolled' R). What's the English symbol?
        _əɹ: This isn't a full on vowel (like in 'curb'), but just a consonant
      - s: true
        z: You're mostly right, but check if this is really voiced or voiceless
        # passing in an explicit `""` symbol (the empty string) is fully optional. It's mostly just
        # to make explicitly clear that this is the end of the word. If not provided
        # it is implied. You don't even need to specify it.
      - "": true
        _e_is_a_lie: Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you.

    segments:

        _j: You're on the right track, but is this really voiced? Double check that
        c: Remember, /c/ is a voiceless palatal stop, and that symbol isn't used in the IPA for English
        ch: The <ch> sound isn't done using a /c/ or an /h/ in IPA.  Think about where your tongue is to start, and remember the 'chocolate' example in lecture!
        tsh: There's a different symbol for the <ch> sound. Use it!
        ts: /ts/ is also an affricate, but it's the sound at the end of 'cats'
        t: Remember, the <ch> sound is comprised of two sounds combined
      - _ɔj: true
        ɔ: This isn't just an /ɔ/, but something more.
        ɔi: This is absolutely a diphthong, and you're on the right track, but we write this diphthong as /ɔj/ in this class (because it's not ending quite as high as /i/.
        _ej: This is the diphthong in 'bay' or 'rain'. Try another.
        aj: This is the diphthong in 'buy' or 'rice'. Try another.
        o...: Generally speaking, in mainstream US English, /ɔ/ is used here.
      - s: true
        z: You're almost there, but is this a voiced or voiceless sound?
        c: Remember, /c/ is a voiceless palatal stop, and that symbol isn't used in the IPA for English.  What -sound- is there?
      - _e_is_a_lie: Are you sure there's another vowel there?  Remember, your writing system is lying to you.

        pɹæktɪs: While that's correct, we want you to transcribe each sound individually (i.e. start with submitting "p")
      - ɹ: true
        r: Remember, English <r> is the flipped /ɹ/
        ə: Maybe you're going for əɹ here?  No, this is a plain old consonantal ɹ, part of the same syllable as p and the next vowel
        əɹ: Maybe you're going for əɹ here?  No, this is a plain old consonantal ɹ, part of the same syllable as p and the next vowel
      - æ: true
        a: Nope, this is a bit more front than this, and /a/ only occurs in diphthongs in English
        ae: Make sure to write this vowel with the digraph /æ/, otherwise it's a sequence of /a/ and /e/
        ɑ: This is the vowel in 'proctor', not 'practice'
        ɛ: This is the vowel in 'predict', not 'practice'
      - k: true
        c: Your writing system is lying to you.  Remember, the IPA /c/ isn't used in English, the written C is always /s/, /k/, or /t͡ʃ/
      - t: true
        ɾ: This isn't a tap, tap is VERY unlikely to occur after another consonant, mostly just between vowels
        d: This can sound a bit /d/ like because it's not aspirated, but it's a /t/
      - ɪ: true
        i: This is the vowel in 'tease', not the one you want here
        aj: This is the diphthongal vowel in 'entice', not what you want here

      - n: true
        m: Nope, the sound in this word is a nasal, but made with the tongue at the alveolar ridge, not by closing the lips
        ŋ: This is a nasal, yes, but ŋ never occurs at the start of English words, and is in words like 'sing'. Is this really a velar sound?
      - ɛ: true
        e: Your writing system is lying to you.  This is always a diphthong in English
        ej: This is the sound in 'neigh'
        ə: This is the first unstressed vowel in 'damascus' not the never vowel
