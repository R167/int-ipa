  For each of the following words, you'll be given both a word in English, and a sound file. Making reference to the
  sound file, you'll give us the IPA character representing each sound in the word, one by one, without slashes or brackets. So, for each word, enter the first complete sound.  This can be a single IPA character, like 's', or, for something more complicated like
  affricates (e.g. 't͡ʃ') or diphthongs (e.g. 'ej') or other multi-symbol characters (e.g. /əɹ/), you might enter multiple symbols
  at once. No need to mark stress with ' or ̩.  When you think you've entered the symbol(s) associated with the first sound completely, press 'Submit IPA
  Symbol(s) or Word' to check your work. Then, do this for the remaining sounds, and when you feel like you've finished
  all the sounds in the word, click 'Submit' one last time. You'll get less 'guidance' as the exercise goes on.  Godspeed!

  Good luck!

      - d: true
      - ɑ: true
        a: /a/ is only used in dipthongs in MUSE.  You want /ɑ/
        ɔ: This is probably a /ɑ/, whether you've got the cot/caught merger or not.
        o: Remember that /ow/ is always a diphthong in my dialect of MUSE
        _ow: This is the vowel in 'boat', and unless you're reading this word as 'doge', it isn't the vowel you want here.
      - g: true

      - d͡ʒ: true
      - əɹ: true
        ɛ: This is the vowel in 'air' or 'tear'
        ej: Nope, this doesn't happen in MUSE before /ɹ/
        ə: This is accurate, but we're going to consider əɹ a single vowel chunk
      - "": true
  - display: zones
    audio: zones.wav
    segments:
      - z: true
        s: Nope, you want the voiced variant
        ʒ: This is the sound in 'pleasure' or 'garage', try again.
      - ow: true
        o: This should be /ow/, the diphthong
        u: This would the vowel in 'zoom'
        ʊ: This would be the vowel in 'soot'
      - n: true
        m: This would be a bilabial nasal, made with the lips, like in 'foam'. That's not what's going on here though!
      - z: true
        s: Is this really voiceless?  Your writing system is probably lying to you (although word final voiced sounds can be less voiced than you'd expect in English!)
        _e_is_a_lie: This is your writing system doing a LOT of lying to you.  How many syllables are here?  Is there another vowel? 
      - "": true
  - display: shudder
    audio: shudder.wav
    segments:
      - ʃ: true
        z: This is a voiced alveolar, and that's not the sound you want
        s: Nope, this is too far forward in the mouth
        ʒ: This is the sound in 'pleasure' or 'garage', try again.
      - ʌ: true 
        ə: This sounds like a schwa, but it's a stressed vowel and doesn't 'change' into something else when stressed.  You want /ʌ/
        a: Nope, this only happens in diphthongs, and is probably your writing system lying to you
        aw: This would be the vowel in 'now'
        ɑ: This would be the vowel in 'not'
        æ: This is the vowel in 'gnat' or 'nab'
      - ɾ: true
        t: This isn't a /t/, it's a tap /ɾ/ for most people in connected speech in MUSE
        d: This isn't a /d/, it's a tap /ɾ/, much shorter.
        r: You're right that this sound is a lot like the /r/ in Spanish, but in English, it's /ɾ/
      - əɹ: true
        ɛ: This is the vowel in 'air' or 'tear'
        ej: Nope, this doesn't happen in MUSE before /ɹ/

  - display: chop
    audio: chop.wav
    segments:
      - t͡ʃ: true
        tʃ: This is accurate, but you want the tie bar (t͡ʃ) to mark it as an affricate, not a /t/ /ʃ/ sequence
        ʒ: No, this is the last sound in garage
        ʃ: No, this is the consonant in 'shoosh'
        _j: No, you want the voiceless version
        c: C is a lie in English. What does this actually sound like?
        ch: <ch> is not IPA.  What does this actually sound like?
      - ɑ: true
        a: This is close, but we use /a/ only in diphthongs.
        ɔ: This is probably a /ɑ/, whether you've got the cot/caught merger or not.
        o: Remember that /ow/ is always a diphthong in my dialect of MUSE
        _ow: This is the vowel in 'boat', and unless you're reading this word as the biblical name 'Job', it isn't the vowel you want here.
        æ: This would be the vowel in 'chat' instead

        t: For some, this chunk is /tɹ/, but go ahead and give me /t͡ʃ/ followed by /ɹ/, which is closer.

        ʌ: This sounds like a wedge, but 'gonna' is a word that's usually not stressed at the phrase level, so let's use schwa (ə)
