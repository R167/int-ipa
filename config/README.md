# IntIPA config

This is the config directory and it's where all configuration should live.

```
config                    # Root config folder
├── README.md
├── ex-lign101            # Each class has it's own folder
│   ├── assignment1.yaml  # Each assignment is a file
│   ├── assignment2.yaml  # And you can have multiple per class
│   ├── tasks.yaml        # Data about the class (list of assignments and class name, etc.)
│   └── testSound.wav     # Any other assets like sound files
└── manifest.yaml         # Finally, the root manifest file which has a list of all classes
```
